        <h2>20th February - The First Connection</h2>
        <p>The day Arush added you and I saw, oh, a girl named Avika Bajpai exists. I was so annoying back then. I bugged you and everyone. I felt annoying like everyone hated me. You used to talk to Arush, and that was okay until I started liking you. I remember when you first replied to me with Kishore Kumar lyrics when I was texting, and you replied singing along. Oh, I blushed so hard. I love you, baby, and Iâ€™m forever thankful to you. I donâ€™t know what I would do if I lose you. Give boards and come back fast.</p>

        <h2>7th March - Our First Date</h2>
        <p>I remember not on 7th but on 6th we did the Taylor Swift thing, and the first reel you sent me... the Club Penguin one! Oh god, I love you. I went out with Anshaj, and I kept texting you. Thanks, Avika, for that time because I was going through so much, and you made it better. I was so thankful. I remember you geeking out about books, and I just knew you were the one I wanted to be with. Thanks, Avika, for awkwardly saying, "Kya tumhe mujhe date karna hai?" I love you.</p>

        <h2>27th April - Our First Meeting</h2>
        <p>Oh god, this day was chaotic, but seeing you in the opening ceremony made me feel, "Okay, I have a girlfriend who is pretty." But yeah, I felt bad when I toured the whole school to find you. I was jealous of Aua. I looked like crap, never looked nice. I didnâ€™t deserve you, but thanks for staying with me, never making me feel not enough. Thank you.</p>

        <h2>13th-14th July - Restaurant Meet</h2>
        <p>When I went to the restaurant to see you and blushed so hard, bro, I love you. You're so pretty! I liked that day. I love the day when I see you, when I get babied, when I get photos. Thank you, baby.</p>

        <h2>22nd-24th October - Special Moments</h2>
        <p>Whatever I say about these days is less. Oh god, what I would do to go through them again! I first saw you, and then we went to sit. I wanted to freeze the moment. I love you, baby. When we sat and I opened snacks and we held hands, BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. I WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD! Then you sitting on the right, idk, I love you. If I want anyone on my right, it would be you always. No one compares. You missed my birthday, and thatâ€™s fine because Iâ€™ll forgive you always, but letâ€™s be on topic. So the first day I HELD YOU... YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA. You looked so nice in that blue shirt, bro, love you! Then the second day, I was the luckiest guy there. I love you, baby, YOU IN THAT KURTA. And then, of course, the best day of my life, the last day... so many firsts. We kissed each other and hugged! THAT HUG... I would die to have that hug again. I love you, and I always will. So please donâ€™t lose your baby, because he will definitely fall apart now. Bye and enjoy talking to me instead of reading this. We have our lives to spend together.</p>
